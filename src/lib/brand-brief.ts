=== WHAT BEME IS ===
BeMe is an AI-powered virtual assistant platform that manages customer communications 24/7 across multiple channels. It acts as an "AI twin" — learning and mimicking the user's communication style so customers never know they're talking to AI. BeMe handles calls, messages, emails, and bookings autonomously.

=== CORE PRODUCTS ===
1. AI Voice Assistant — Answers calls, responds to inquiries, provides quotes, books appointments
2. AI Messaging — Responds across WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and email, mirroring the user's communication style
3. AI Calendar/Scheduling — Intelligent appointment booking based on availability, location, and working hours
4. Mobile & Web App — Available on iOS App Store, Google Play, and web

=== TARGET AUDIENCE ===
- Self-employed professionals
- Trades workers and contractors (plumbers, electricians, builders, etc.)
- Small business owners
- Side hustlers
- Content creators and influencers
- Coaches, consultants, freelancers
- Service-based businesses needing customer interaction management

=== KEY MESSAGING ===
Primary: "Never miss another call, message, email, or booking from your customer ever again."
BeMe is positioned as an extension of YOU, not a separate tool. It's personal, it learns your style, and it works while you sleep.

- Learns and mimics YOUR communication style — sounds like you, not a robot
- 24/7 availability without human intervention
- Multi-channel: voice, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, email, calendar

- Real Solutions for Real People — practical focus on missed calls, managing channels, switching off
